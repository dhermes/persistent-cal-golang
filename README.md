### Description

This repository contains server and client code for
the `persistent-cal` [App Engine][1] application.

The application enables persistent import of an [iCalendar][2] feed into a
Google Calendar.

**For example**, events from a [TripIt][3] feed can be
periodically added to a user's default Google Calendar (perhaps
one shared with coworkers or collaborators).

See the [about page][4] of the deployed version of this application
for more information
